## Hi there 👋

After a year and a half of working as a junior software developer, I’ve decided it’s time to shake things up with some personal projects and dive into new technologies just for fun. Finishing my degree left me feeling a bit overwhelmed, and I didn’t get much chance to play around with new ideas. Now, I’m excited to break free from that grind and explore cool projects, experiment with different tech, and really have some fun with what I’ve learned! (July 2024)

## 🚀 What I’m Working On

- Building personal projects that leverage new technologies and concepts.
- Exploring new trends and integrating them into my projects.

Here are some of the projects I’m currently working on:
### ♟️ Chess application
In July 2024, I decided to dive back into a fun project: reimagining a chess game I built way back in one of my first Java courses. This time around, I’m starting from scratch and using all the cool skills I’ve picked up since then. I’m planning to break the app into containerized chunks, so I can play around with different frontend and backend tech in a super flexible way. It’s going to be a great mix of revisiting old ideas and trying out new ones—basically, a playground for experimenting and learning as I go!
