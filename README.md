## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After a year and a half of working as a junior software developer, Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s time to shake things up with some personal projects and dive into new technologies just for fun. Finishing my degree left me feeling a bit overwhelmed, and I didnâ€™t get much chance to play around with new ideas. Now, Iâ€™m excited to break free from that grind and explore cool projects, experiment with different tech, and really have some fun with what Iâ€™ve learned! (July 2024)

Here are some ideas to get you started:
